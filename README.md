# Cipher-Text-Decoder
Created a Python application that recover the encryption key and plain text of the Vigenere cipher text using Kerckhoff's method.
Application first accepts the cipher text and shift the list to the right for finding the number of coincidence. Further, it counts the alphabets that coincide with the original list and finds its available number of key lengths.
Based on the key lengths and English letter frequency, it deciphers the cipher text.
